Lessons From Science Fiction <em>and</em> Fantasy
<!--
	In the summer of 2004, I took a course that changed the way I think about everything.

	Ideas from Different Fields are often used to inspire and grow another. Much of the principles of Web Design are a hundred year old ideas from Print Design.  Much of Computer Science is the application of 1000 year old ideas of Mathematics.

Transferring <em>Ideas</em>

	So I thought it might be fun to look at some other fields, specifically one that I love, and see if there are ideas and lessons we could learn from there an apply to making websites.

	The WordPress Core Team is the United Federation of Planets.  It's many unique Individuals, united by a common mission.  Whereas The United Federation of Planets aimed to make the entire universe a better place for everyone, WordPress aims to make the Web a better place for everyone.

United Federation of Planets
<!--
	The UFP charter states: 

	We the lifeforms of the United Federation of Planets determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, and to reaffirm faith in the fundamental rights of sentient beings, in the dignity and worth of all lifeforms, in the equal rights of members of planetary systems large and small, and to establish conditions under which justice and respect for the obligations arising from treaties and other sources of interstellar law can be maintained, and to promote social progress and better standards of living on all worlds...

	Resistance is futile, yet they never succeed. In many ways WordPress's version of the Borg is the propritary CMS world.  These CMSs lock you in. You don't own your data. It's not a community working together to create something, it is one someone's idea of how you should create content.

	There are other lifeforms out there as well.  In the Star Trek Universe, there is a species called the ferangi that live off of rules of acquision. 
	Rule of Aquision #59: Free advice is seldom cheap.
	Rule of Aquision #109: Dignity and an empty sack is worth the sack.
	
	The Ferengi are almost soley after profit. They aren't interested in actually helping people. In the Web, we have a similar group: SEO Consultants. SEO consultants rant and rave about the rules, but at the end of the day most of them are interested in there own profits.  If you are really interested in SEO I will give you the two pieces of advice you need: If it makes your users happy, it will make google happy and Write good content that people want to read.
